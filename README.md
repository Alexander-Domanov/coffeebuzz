# CoffeeBuzz ☕

A small project for practicing modular architecture of styles using **Sass**.

## 📓 Description
**CoffeeBuzz** is a single-page website created to experiment with:

- Organizing SCSS into modules
- Using variables, mixins, and nesting
- Basic HTML structure and styling
- Project structure based on principles of clean and scalable markup

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **HTML5**
- **SCSS (Sass)**
- **CSS3**

## 🗂️ Project Structure
1. **index.html**: the main file of the website.
2. **SASS/**: contains the source SCSS files that will be compiled into CSS.
   - **base/**: base styles applied across the entire project (e.g., reset, typography).
   - **components/**: styles for reusable components like buttons, cards, etc.
   - **layout/**: styles for the overall site layout, including grid, header, and footer.
   - **utils/**: utility styles like variables, mixins, and functions to simplify CSS management.
   - **main.scss**: the entry point for compiling SCSS into the final CSS file.
3. **css/**: folder containing the compiled CSS files used in the project.
4. **img/**: folder for images used on the website.
5. **icons/**: folder for icons used in the project interface.
6. **videos/**: folder for video files, if present.
